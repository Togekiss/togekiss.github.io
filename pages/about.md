# **About Me**

Hi, I am **Marta Zapatero!** Also known online as 'Meli' under *melissenpai* :wave:

I'm a support main with a skillset centered around removing debuffs `(QA)`, applying buffs `(DevOps)`, and dropping experience multipliers `(Technical Writing)`. But my build is very flexible; I'm a jack of all trades with high leveling rates `(I learn fast)`.

Although I'm more than viable solo `(Self-sufficient)`, my gameplay style is geared towards multiplayer `(Teamwork)`.

I have strong presence in early game `(Design and writing)`. Once I help my teammates farm and level up `(Train new hires)` I take a more supportive role during mid and late game `(Team management)`.

By the end of the game, I might not be the player with the highest damage, but I've worked hard to bring the team to victory!
