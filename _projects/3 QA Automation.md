# My job as a QA Automation Engineer

NDAs are great, but they also mean there's no easy way to showcase your hard work to other people.

However, I will try to look for examples I can safely modify to post snippets here.

Things to talk about in this page:
* Selenium and TestCaf√© scripting
* API testing and frontend calls debugging
* Detailed internal documentation in Confluence
* Jira bug reporting and automatic integration
* Jenkins daily and per-build pipelines
* Visual testing scripts
* Making testing-friendly modifications to the frontend
* HTML scraping
* SonarQube
* Growing the team, training and managing new members
