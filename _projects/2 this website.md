# This website

I have a creative soul, but what brings food to my table is the invisible work of QA... I was not expecting to need a Frontend CV anytime soon! 

But life's workings are mysterious. So with a 10'' tablet and a bluetooth keyboard, I set to work and make this Github page.

It's been a brief two days, and I already love Jekyll and Liquid. I believe code reusablity is one of the pillars of good development, and Liquid's template-based language offers that in spades.

The ability to mix Liquid, markdown and plain HTML seamlessly is not only very flexible, but incredibly user-friendly- something I put a lot of emphasis on. I'm particularly focusing on it in [my wiki project](/projects/3-dl-elysium-wiki).

Sure, I am using a [lovely theme](https://github.com/yousinix/portfolYOU) as a base to speed things up. If I wanted to flex and I had plenty of time, I could make everything from scratch. But there is no need to reinvent the wheel if there are flexible tools at our disposal- and knowing how to use existing frameworks as **Boostrap** is a valuable skill as well.

And I'm itching to make this theme my own. As days go by and I work on it, I'll surely modify it to suit my needs until it's barely recognisable. But I'll focus on the content of the page first, and simply type my TODOs down below.


<h3>Things I would / will do with more time:</h3>

* Modify `_includes/elements/button.html` and `_includes/elements/figure.html` to add size and alignment control to the template.
* Align better these small in-line code snippets.
* ~~Add word wrapping to large code blocks~~ Done!
* Add more spacing between the page title and the content.
* Add mobile-specific styles to the Wiki widgets
