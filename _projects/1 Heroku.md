# Heroku

I have developed several demos and prototypes of websites and applications over the years... but as of last week, I did not have any platform to host operational versions to make them accessible online; they have either stayed in local, internal environments, or taken down from old hosting sites.

So, after a brief research, I settled on **Heroku** to host a couple of full-stack demos. It's cheap, offers a nice integration with Github, and can host full-stack websites.

The demos I have hosted, for now, are just that: old prototypes that I have patched up back into being online. Take this project as proof of adaptability and learning speed, more than about the demos themselves.

This Instagram copy was built *completely* from scratch using PHP with Symfony and Twig to create a dynamic website, a SQL dabatase, and with SASS and Boostrap taking care of the frontend.

As it's an old prototype, many of the frameworks used are outdated or deprecated, and it needed a few patches to be up and running again as fast as possible... things that would be fixed if the end goal was production.

This is also a full-stack prototype. As the second one I uploaded to Heroku, the process was already much faster.

Unfortunately this was mostly focused on backend practise, and the Bootstrap template used on the frontend looks rather broken at the moment. It's  low on my list of priorities, but I'll give it a paint job when I'm able to~
